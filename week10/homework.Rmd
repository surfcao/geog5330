# Question \#1

The R package 'spdep' includes a shape file 'columbus.shp' which is a dataset of
neighborhood-level information on crime, mean home value, mean income, and other
variables for 49 neighborhoods in Columbus, OH, during 1980. Based on what we
have learned on the spatial analysis of areal data, please finish the following
R codes.

```{r homework, eval=T, echo=T}
rm(list=ls())

library(spdep)
library(maptools)
library(RColorBrewer)


columbus.poly <- readShapePoly(system.file("etc/shapes/columbus.shp", package="spdep")[1])


# Based on the shape file, please build neighorhood using Rook adjacency rule (hint: poly2nb).


# Convert the neigbohood specification to a adjacent weight matrix (hint:nb2listw)


## Please run Moran test for the crime values in the dataset (columbus.poly$CRIME), and explain the output (hint:moran.test).


## Please run the SAR model using CRIME as the dependent variables and house values (HOVAL) and income (INC) as your explainary varibles, and explain the outputs (hint:spautolm). 



```
