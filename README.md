## Course description

With the continuing advances of geographic information science and
geospatial technologies, spatially referenced information have been
easily and increasingly available in the past decades and becoming
important information sources in scientific research and decision making
processes. To effectively take advantage of the rich collection of
spatial (and temporal) data, statistical analysis is often necessary,
e.g., to extract implicit knowledge such as spatial relations and
patterns that are not explicit in the data. Spatial data analysis
distinguishes itself from classical data analysis in that spatial
analysis focuses on locations, areas, distances, relationships and
interactions of measurements that are usually referenced as points,
lines, and areal units in geographical spaces. In the past decades, a
plethora of theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis have been
developed from different perspectives, and together with GIS, converged
as fruitful fields of geographic information science (GIScience) and
spatial statistics.

The purpose of this class is to present the commonly used methods and
current trends in spatial and spatiotemporal data analysis, and
innovative applications in relevant fields (e.g., environmental science
and engineering, natural resources management, ecology, public health,
climate sciences, civil engineering, and social sciences). Students are
expected to actively participate in class, read assigned articles and
develop a project of their own choice or directly related to their
thesis/dissertation topics. In the first four weeks or so, I will review
the basic principles and commonly used methods and tools in spatial and
spatiotemporal analysis, and in the following weeks, students will be
reading a collection of papers produced by key researchers and
practitioners in various cognate fields and present them during class
time. The assigned papers will be closely related to each student’s
major or dissertation/thesis topic. The topics of these papers will
include, but not limited to:

-   Exploratory spatial data analysis and visual analytics

-   Spatial point process (e.g., occurrence of wild life, crimes and
    diseases)

-   Analysis of movement trajectories (e.g., movement trajectories of
    animals and birds)

-   Spatiotemporal disease mapping

-   Space-time geostatistics

-   Statistical downscaling and change of spatial supports

-   Spatial uncertainty mapping and impact assessment

-   Time series remote sensing imagery analysis and change detection

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites of this course includes an understanding of basic concepts
of spatial analysis and spatial statistics, which could be fulfilled
with <span>*GIST 5302*</span> or first-year graduate level of statistics
courses. However, students from different disciplines are welcome,
please contact the instructor should there any question about the
prerequisites.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this course, the graduate students of this class are
expected to be able to:

-   formulate real-world problems in the context of spatial and
    spatiotemporal analysis with a knowledge of basic concepts and
    principles in this field

-   apply appropriate spatial and spatiotemporal analytical methods to
    solve the formulated problems, and be able to critically review
    alternative methods and other’s work

-   utilize available scripting, programmable scientific computing tools
    (e.g., R) to make maps, solve spatial and spatiotemporal analysis
    problems, and evaluate and assess the results of alternative tools

-   communicate effectively the results of analysis in forms of academic
    writing and presentation

## Readings

-   Handouts will be circulated as class progresses and required
    textbook is needed for this course

-   A reading list of articles are provided in Section [reading] of this
    syllabus. The following books will be frequently referred to for
    reading:

    -   Bivand Roger S., Pebesma, Edzer J., and Gómez-Rubio, Virgilio
        (2008), *Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R*, Springer (eBook
        available at TTU library).

    -   Cressie, N., & Wikle, C. K. (2011). *Statistics for
        Spatio-temporal Data*. John Wiley & Sons.

## Assessment

The assessment of students understanding of the learning outcomes will
be based on the following items:

-   Readings and class presentation: Each student will be expected to
    read 8-10 papers in their fields during the semester and critically
    present them in class. The performance will be evaluated based on
    the following aspects:

    -   Clarity of presentation (40%)

    -   Indication that the student understands the methods in the
        assigned papers and knows why they were used compared to
        alternative methods (30%)

    -   Evidence that the student can critically read and evaluate the
        findings of the papers (30%)

-   Final project: Each student will be expected to write a proposal of
    the final project in the middle of the semester, finish the proposed
    activities, present the results of the projects, and finally submit
    an associated project report.

    -   Specifically the project proposal will be evaluated based on the
        following criteria:

        -   The objective of the proposal is practical and can be
            finished during the class time, and the student already has
            the necessary data ready to be analyzed (30%)

        -   The proposal will use appropriate methods of analysis for
            the proposed objectives (30%)

        -   The proposal is well written and clearly stated, with all
            the following required elements included (40%):
            introduction, motivation and description of the problem,
            review of current literature (related to the assigned
            readings), sources of data, and anticipated results.

    -   The final presentation and the final report will be both
        evaluated according to the following criteria:

        -   Evidence that the student has finished the proposed analysis
            (40%)

        -   Findings based on the analysis results have been clearly
            elaborated, and the proposed objective has been achieved
            (30%)

        -   The report is well written and the presentation is clear,
            with all the following required elements included (30%):
            introduction, motivation and description of the problem,
            review of current literature (related to the assigned
            readings), sources of data, adopted methods of analysis,
            results and discussions.

## University policy

-   Academic honesty (OP 34.12):

    From OP 34.12: “It is the aim of the faculty of Texas Tech
    University to foster a spirit of complete honesty and high standard
    of integrity. The attempt of students to present as their own any
    work not honestly performed is regarded by the faculty and
    administration as a most serious offense and renders the offenders
    liable to serious consequences, possibly suspension. “Scholastic
    dishonesty” includes, but it not limited to, cheating, plagiarism,
    collusion, falsifying academic records, misrepresenting facts, and
    any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to the student
    (such as, but not limited to, submission of essentially the same
    written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of
    the instructor) or the attempt to commit such an act.”

-   Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the
    Rehabilitation Act (OP 10.08)

    Any student who, because of a disability, might require special
    arrangements in order to meet the course requirements should contact
    the instructor as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements
    either at the beginning of the semester or upon diagnosis of
    disability. Students must present appropriate verification from
    Student Disability Services during the instructor’s office hours.
    Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom
    accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from
    Student Disability Services has been provided. For additional
    information, please contact Student Disability Services office in
    335 West Hall or call 806-742-2405.

-   Students absence for observance of a religious holy day (OP 34.19):

    -   “Religious holy day” means a holy day observed by a religion
        whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under
        Texas Tax Code §11.20.

    -   A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should
        make that intention known in writing to the instructor prior to
        the absence. A student who is absent from classes for the
        observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an
        examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day
        within a reasonable time after the absence.

    -   A student who is excused under section 2 may not be penalized
        for the absence; however, the instructor may respond
        appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment
        satisfactorily.

-   Safety Procedures: In the event of a fire alarm or building alarm
    that is not for a tornado students should follow the instructor to
    the exit that has been established in the building safety document.
    To exit students should proceed to the right of the room, down the
    hall to the exit doors facing east. Students should proceed to the
    south east and wait by the fire stairs outside the xx building until
    the all clear has been sounded. In the event of a tornado students
    should follow the instructor along the hall that runs north of the
    class room, then to the nearest stairway that leads to the basement.
